    "### Scope\n",
    "- The system focuses on predicting burnout risk scores using workload, behavioral, and temporal data.\n",
    "- Both classical machine learning and deep learning models are explored.\n",
    "- Generative AI is used to provide recommendations, not decisions.\n",
    "- The system is designed as a decision-support tool rather than an automated enforcement system.\n",

    "### Constraints\n",
    "- The system does not perform medical or psychological diagnosis.\n",
    "- Recommendations are advisory and require human judgment.\n",
    "- Data used in this project combines public datasets and synthetic data due to privacy limitations.\n",
    "- Real-time integration with enterprise tools is outside the current project scope.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Burnout risk scores are probabilistic and advisory, not definitive judgments.\n",
    "- Employee-level insights are privacy-aware and role-based.\n",
    "- Managers and HR do not receive individual mental health labels.\n",
    "- All recommendations are optional and require human discretion.\n",
    "- The system avoids invasive monitoring or surveillance-based data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to support employee well-being and sustainable productivity, not to penalize or rank individuals.\n"
